# MERFISH-mouse-comparison
Jupyter notebooks for generating figures for "Comparative analysis of MERFISH spatial transcriptomics with bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing".

To run the notebooks, first download the processed data files at XX. Make sure that the data folder is in the same directory that this repository is in.

Note that Figures 1 and 2 are not included in this repository, as the Figure 1 was illustrated and Figure 2 utilizes closed source code from Vizgen Inc.
